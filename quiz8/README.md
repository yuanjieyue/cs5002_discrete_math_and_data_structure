# Quiz 8

## Instructions

Copy this directory into the root of your repository. 
Implementations for all functions declared in the 
header `quiz8.h` should go in `quiz8.c`.

## Commands

To compile: `make`

To clean: `make clean`

To run: `./quiz8`

## Notes / Advice

* Implement functions in the order the tests are called under main() in `quiz8_test.c`. 
It's a good idea to do this since tests will call functions that were previously tested.
