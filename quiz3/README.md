# Quiz 3

Copy this directory into the root of your repository. Your solutions will consist of the code you type into quiz3.c. 

This week we are also introducing the use of a makefile. The makefile replaces
running gcc to compile your code. If you want to know more about it, here (http://mrbook.org/blog/tutorials/make/) is a good reference article to get you started. We'll talk about it in class a little bit more on Monday, but here's what you need to get started: 

To compile: `make`

To run: `./quiz3`

To clean: `make clean`
