 * This function should print all the numbers from to 1 to the number specified by

 * when the number is divisible by bang_num, it should print 'Bang'.
 *
 * If the number is divisible by more than one of the three specified numbers, it should
 * print the equivalent for all divisible numbers.
 *
 * For example, for the call fizzbuzzbang(60, 2, 3, 5):
 * 1                       // 1
 * Fizz                    // 2
 * Buzz                    // 3
 * Fizz                    // 4

 * FizzBuzz                // 6
